						The Aetas are a nomadic indigenous group who live in isolated mountainous parts of Luzon. Their clothing is simple. As we see in the picture, they simply use barkcloth or loincloth that wraps around their waist and passes through their legs or wraps around their bodies. However, it is also worth noting that due to many tourists, or even locals, that want to learn their culture, they end up adapting the culture of those they meet. Hence, some Aetas now wear t-shirts and sandals.

						The Ifugao people inhabit the Ifugao province up north at the Cordillera Administrative Region and are a sub-group under the Igorot. Ifugao men wear a loincloth known as wanoh, and its simplicity helps them to move easily while doing their tasks. Meanwhile, the women wear a wraparound skirt called an ampuyo, which has personalized designs to convey a story.

Meanwhile, the women wear a skirt or a gateng. Both wear a tapis, which is wrapped around their upper body, and headgear that is sometimes adorned with feathers. Their clothing varies from tribe to tribe.

						The T'boli people live in the southern part of Mindanao and are well known for their traditional handwoven cloth called t'nalak. They, of course, use this for their clothing, but it is not limited to that. This tradition is practiced by the women, and they have gained the title "dream weavers." This is because it was believed back then that the designs and patterns are shown in their dreams by the goddess Fu Dalu.
